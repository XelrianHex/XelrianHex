- 👋 Hi, I’m @XelrianHex
- 👀 I'm working on escaping the factory life through coding.
- 🌱 I’m currently using freeCodeCamp to further my education.
- 💞️ Here I will post my projects for all the different languages I'm learning.
- ⚡ Though I'm largely interested in data structure/science my codes here will be in what ever field/language I'm learning at the time.
