# ❇ Hi there! I'm **Xelrian Hex** ❇

- 📚 I'm currently using *[FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)* to further my education in self taught programming.
- 🦾 Previously I had read and used *["Automate the Boring Stuff With Python"](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)* online book to learn a great deal about Python.
- 🏁 My goal is to switch careers. The factory life is wearing on me and I need an escape! 🏁
- 🏞 ❓ I am undecided on which path I would like to take. I hope by the end of my *FreeCodeCamp* education I will have a more clear path in mind.
